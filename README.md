# Telegram-bot - Shein-sale-bot
***
### My project Shein_sale_bot is an example of work in creating a bot that independently uploads brief information about products from the famous foreign site Shein only at a discount, having previously saved it in dictionary format in order to create publications on the [Telegram-channel](https://t.me/sheininsale) in the future.
***
The idea of the project was taken from the current topics of Telegram-channels, where various products with a big discount Wildberries and Ozon are published, as an example for studying the topic of parsing and not only.
[Shein_sale_bot](https://t.me/Shein_sale_bot) is just a layout and has a lot of shortcomings, such as automation and saving data in JSON format, and not to a server or database, but its presence in the portfolio is explained by the fact that there are understandings and skills in creating such Telegram-bots.
